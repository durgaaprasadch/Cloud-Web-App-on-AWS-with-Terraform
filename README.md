# Cloud-Web-App-on-AWS-with-Terraform
This project automates the deployment of a complete multi-tier web application infrastructure on AWS using Terraform. It provisions a secure VPC, public and private subnets, an EC2 web server, an RDS PostgreSQL database, and an S3 bucket for static assets â€” all fully managed through Infrastructure-as-Code.
